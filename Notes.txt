Todo:
1. Create ProductComponent.
5. List the discount code description when discount code is apply. Error msg if it's invalid discount code.
6. Use express and json-server rather than mock api for backend.
11. Fix the commented out test in ProductList.test.js

Done:
2. Format amount.
3. toaster
4. Spinner.
8. Handle adding multiple floating number in javascript
9. Handle remove item from the list.
10. Unit test.
12. Use useSelect and useDispatch... Create backup file for this. There is not online testing solution and I don't want to just test match snapshot. So roll back.
13. Try to use LESS or SASS     << Create-react-app by default support SASS and CSS module.
7. Do eslint.                   << Will not do this part as setting up custom eslint required to eject create-react-app. Create-react-app is indeed in a much lower standard than angular cli.
